			<h2>Why Tree Plantation is Important</h2>
			<p>Tree plantation is important for various reasons. Trees help to combat climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They also provide oxygen and improve air quality. Trees help to prevent soil erosion and improve water quality by filtering rainwater. They also provide habitat for wildlife and contribute to biodiversity.</p>

			<h2>How to Plant Trees</h2>
			<p>Planting a tree is a simple process. First, choose the right species for your area. Make sure the tree is healthy and has a good root system. Dig a hole twice as wide as the treeâ€™s root ball and plant the tree at the same depth as it was in the container. Water the tree well and add a layer of mulch around the base of the tree.</p>
