            <h2>How to Reduce Pollution</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to reduce pollution. We can reduce our use of fossil fuels by using public transportation, walking, or biking instead of driving. We can also switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Recycling and reducing waste can also help to reduce pollution. Additionally, supporting policies and regulations that limit pollution can have a significant impact.</p>
